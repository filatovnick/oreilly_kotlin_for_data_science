# Introduction to "From Data Science to Production with Kotlin"

Hey everyone, my name is Thomas Nield. Today I want to talk about "From Data Science to Production with Kotlin". This is the first of a two-part video series on using the Kotlin platform for data science and data engineering.

Data science is a broad buzzword that continues to put more disciplines under its umbrella, from ETL (extract, transform, load) to applied statistics and machine learning. Another part of the data science domain that is increasingly getting attention is taking data science and data engineering and putting it in production. Kotlin can excel at all of these tasks capturing the entire data science supply chain, and when you encounter limitations Kotlin provides tools to quickly adapt itself towards a solution.

Kotlin is a pragmatic, industry-focused programming language built by JetBrains, the same company behind Intellij IDEA, PyCharm, Resharper, and other leading developer tools. In this class we will discuss the motivation behind Kotlin, and why it can be a compelling option for data science even though capable solutions like Python already exist. We will then dive into the fundamentals of the language for the purposes of data science.

So without further delay, let's get started.


# Introduction to "Practical Data Modeling for Production with Kotlin"

Hey everyone, my name is Thomas Nield. Today I want to talk about "Practical Data Modeling for Production with Kotlin". This is the second of a two-part video series on using the Kotlin platform for data science and data engineering. If you are not familiar with Kotlin or have not viewed "From Data Science to Production with Kotlin", please watch those video segments first.

Data science is a broad buzzword that continues to put more disciplines under its umbrella, from ETL (extract, transform, load) to applied statistics and machine learning. Another part of the data science domain that is increasingly getting attention is taking data science and putting it in production. Kotlin can excel at all of these tasks capturing the entire data science supply chain, and when you encounter limitations Kotlin provides tools to quickly adapt itself towards a solution.

In this class, we will leverage some of Kotlin's more advanced features to quickly express business logic on the data science domain, as well as look at practical applications towards analytics, statistics, ETL, matrix work, and machine learning.

Let's move forward and get started.

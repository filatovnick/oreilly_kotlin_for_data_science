Hey everyone, my name is Thomas Nield. Today I want to talk about "From Data Science to Production, with Kotlin". This is the first of a two-part video series on using the Kotlin platform for data science and data engineering.

Data science is a broad domain that continues to put more disciplines under its umbrella, from ETL (extract, transform, load) processes to applied statistics and machine learning. Another part of the data science domain that is increasingly getting attention is taking data science and data engineering and putting it in production. Kotlin can excel at all of these tasks capturing the entire data science supply chain, and when you encounter limitations Kotlin provides tools to quickly adapt itself towards a solution.

Kotlin is a pragmatic, industry-focused programming language built by JetBrains, the same company behind Intellij IDEA, PyCharm, Resharper, and other leading developer tools. In this class we will discuss the motivation behind the creation of Kotlin, and why it can be a compelling platform for data science even though capable ones like Python already exist.

So without further delay, let's get started.
